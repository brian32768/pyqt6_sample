The roads were placed as best as possible to the center of the road based on each of these underlying data sources. Roads were attirbuted with Functional Classifications based on local Transportation System Plans (TSP) when available. The functional classes were then grouped together to aid in their display on Clatsop County WebMaps and for easier use in cartographic representation (i.e. symbology).</idAbs><idCredit></idCredit><idPurp></idPurp><resConst><Consts><useLimit></useLimit></Consts></resConst></dataIdInfo></metadata>
